### Module 3: Building Interactive Web Pages

#### Section 6: Introduction to Debugging Tools

#### Student Tasks

### Task 1: Inspecting and Modifying HTML and CSS

1. **Objective**: Learn to inspect and modify HTML and CSS using browser developer tools.
2. **Steps**:
    - Open any webpage (e.g., a simple HTML page you have created).
    - Open the developer tools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Opt+I`).
    - Go to the **Elements** panel.
    - Inspect the HTML structure and CSS styles.
    - Modify the content of an HTML element.
    - Change the CSS style of an element (e.g., change the background color).
3. **Deliverable**: Take screenshots before and after making changes, and provide a brief description of the changes you made.

### Task 2: Logging and Viewing Errors

1. **Objective**: Understand how to use the console to log messages and view errors.
2. **Steps**:
    - Create a simple HTML file with an embedded JavaScript script.
    - Add `console.log()`, `console.error()`, and `console.warn()` statements in your script.
    - Introduce an intentional error (e.g., calling a non-existent function).
    - Open the developer tools and go to the **Console** panel.
    - Reload the page and observe the logged messages and error.
3. **Deliverable**: Provide the HTML and JavaScript code along with a screenshot of the console output showing the log messages and errors.

### Task 3: Setting Breakpoints and Debugging

1. **Objective**: Learn to set breakpoints and step through code using the developer tools.
2. **Steps**:
    - Create an HTML file with a linked JavaScript file containing a simple function.
    - Write a function that performs a basic calculation (e.g., adding two numbers).
    - Set a breakpoint inside the function using the **Sources** panel.
    - Reload the page to hit the breakpoint.
    - Use the stepping commands to debug the function and inspect variable values.
3. **Deliverable**: Provide the HTML and JavaScript code, and take screenshots showing the breakpoint, the stepping process, and the variable values at each step.

### Task 4: Debugging a Simple Web Application

1. **Objective**: Apply debugging techniques to a simple web application.
2. **Steps**:
    - Use a pre-built simple web application (or create one) that has a form for user input and displays the result.
    - Intentionally introduce some bugs (e.g., incorrect variable names, logic errors).
    - Use the developer tools to identify and fix the bugs.
    - Document the process of finding and fixing each bug, including screenshots and explanations.
3. **Deliverable**: Provide the original and fixed code, along with a detailed report of the debugging process, including screenshots and explanations of the errors and fixes.

### Task 5: Debugging Asynchronous Code

1. **Objective**: Learn to debug asynchronous JavaScript code using the developer tools.
2. **Steps**:
    - Create an HTML file with a script that makes an asynchronous fetch request to a public API.
    - Introduce an intentional error in the fetch request or response handling.
    - Open the developer tools and set breakpoints to debug the asynchronous code.
    - Use the stepping commands to follow the execution flow and inspect variable values.
3. **Deliverable**: Provide the HTML and JavaScript code, and take screenshots showing the breakpoints, the stepping process, and the variable values at each step.
