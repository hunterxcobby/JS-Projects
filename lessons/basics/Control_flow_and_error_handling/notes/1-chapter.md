In JavaScript, control flow statements play a crucial role in structuring your code and enabling interactivity. Let's explore the block statement, a fundamental element for grouping statements.

### Block Statement:
The block statement is used to group multiple statements together, forming a block of code enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  statement1;
  statement2;
  // â€¦
  statementN;
}
```

**Usage:**
Block statements are commonly employed with control flow statements such as `if`, `for`, and `while`. For instance:

```javascript
while (x < 10) {
  x++;
}
```

In this example, `{ x++; }` constitutes the block statement.

**Note on Scoping:**
- Variables declared with `var` are not block-scoped. They are scoped to the containing function or script, and their effects persist beyond the block itself.

**Example:**
```javascript
var x = 1;
{
  var x = 2;
}
console.log(x); // Outputs 2
```

In this case, the variable `x` declared within the block affects the outer scope. To avoid such scoping issues, it's recommended to use `let` or `const` for block-scoped variables.

The block statement is a foundational building block for structuring JavaScript code and is extensively used in conjunction with various control flow statements.
