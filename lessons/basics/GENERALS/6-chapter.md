### Understanding Arithmetic Operators in JavaScript:

#### Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic operators in JavaScript perform mathematical calculations on numeric values. Here are the main arithmetic operators:

1. **Addition (`+`):**
   - Adds two values.

   ```javascript
   const sum = 5 + 3;  // Result: 8
   ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`):**
   - Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

   ```javascript
   const difference = 10 - 4;  // Result: 6
   ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`):**
   - Multiplies two values.

   ```javascript
   const product = 3 * 7;  // Result: 21
   ```

4. **Division (`/`):**
   - Divides the left operand by the right operand.

   ```javascript
   const quotient = 20 / 5;  // Result: 4
   ```

5. **Modulus (`%`):**
   - Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.

   ```javascript
   const remainder = 15 % 4;  // Result: 3 (because 15 / 4 is 3 with a remainder of 3)
   ```

6. **Increment (`++`):**
   - Increases the value of a variable by 1.

   ```javascript
   let count = 5;
   count++;  // Now count is 6
   ```

7. **Decrement (`--`):**
   - Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

   ```javascript
   let score = 8;
   score--;  // Now score is 7
   ```

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 3;

const sum = num1 + num2;        // 13
const difference = num1 - num2;  // 7
const product = num1 * num2;     // 30
const quotient = num1 / num2;    // 3.3333...
const remainder = num1 % num2;   // 1

let count = 5;
count++;  // Increment: count is now 6

let score = 8;
score--;  // Decrement: score is now 7
```

Arithmetic operators are essential for performing mathematical calculations in JavaScript, whether it's simple addition or more complex operations involving variables. Understanding how to use these operators is fundamental for working with numeric data in your programs.
