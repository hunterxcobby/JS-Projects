In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. In the context of an object's method, `this` is equivalent to the object itself. This allows you to use the same method definition for multiple objects.

For example, consider two person objects:

```javascript
const person1 = {
  name: "Chris",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};

const person2 = {
  name: "Deepti",
  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
  },
};
```

Now, when you call `person1.introduceSelf()`, it outputs "Hi! I'm Chris.", and `person2.introduceSelf()` outputs "Hi! I'm Deepti." The method's code is exactly the same in each case, demonstrating the usefulness of `this` when creating multiple objects with shared functionality.
