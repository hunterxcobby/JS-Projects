**Functions in JavaScript:**

Functions are a way to package and reuse blocks of code. They help avoid repetitive coding by allowing you to define a set of instructions that can be executed whenever needed. Here's an overview:

1. **Built-in Functions:**
   - Examples of built-in functions include `document.querySelector` and `alert`, which are part of the browser environment. They come pre-defined for you to use.

   ```javascript
   let myVariable = document.querySelector("h1");
   alert("hello!");
   ```

2. **Creating Your Own Function:**
   - You can define your own functions to perform specific tasks. Here's an example of a function that multiplies two numbers:

   ```javascript
   function multiply(num1, num2) {
     let result = num1 * num2;
     return result;
   }
   ```

   To use this function, you call it with specific arguments (inputs):

   ```javascript
   multiply(4, 7);      // Returns 28
   multiply(20, 20);    // Returns 400
   multiply(0.5, 3);    // Returns 1.5
   ```

3. **Arguments:**
   - Functions often take arguments, which are pieces of data they need to perform their task. Arguments are placed inside the parentheses and are separated by commas if there's more than one.

   ```javascript
   function exampleFunction(arg1, arg2) {
     // Function body using arg1 and arg2
   }
   ```

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The `return` statement is used to send a value back from the function. In the `multiply` function example, `return result;` ensures that the result of the multiplication is available for further use.

   ```javascript
   let resultOfMultiplication = multiply(4, 7);
   ```

   This helps manage the scope of variables; anything declared inside a function is usually only accessible within that function unless explicitly returned.



An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that does not have a name. It is often used when a function is only needed for a short period or as a parameter to another function, like in event handling. 

Here's an example of a named function:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

And here's the equivalent anonymous function using the arrow function syntax:

```javascript
let addNumbers = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

The arrow function version:

```javascript
let addNumbers = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

In the context of event handling, anonymous functions are commonly used as callback functions, providing the code that should run when an event occurs. For example:

```javascript
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

In this case, the function used as the second argument to `addEventListener` is anonymous because it doesn't have a specific name assigned to it. It's a concise way to define a function for a specific purpose without the need for a separate function declaration.
