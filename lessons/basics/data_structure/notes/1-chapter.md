**Dynamic Typing:**
1. **Definition:**
   - JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
   - This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and a variable can hold values of any type.

2. **Example:**
   ```javascript
   let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
   foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
   foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
   ```
   - Here, the variable `foo` starts as a number, then becomes a string, and finally becomes a boolean. The type of `foo` can change during the execution of the program.

**Weak Typing:**
1. **Definition:**
   - JavaScript is a weakly typed language.
   - This means that JavaScript allows implicit type conversion during operations involving mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.

2. **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const foo = 42; // foo is a number
   const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
   console.log(result); // Outputs: "421"
   ```
   - Here, the addition operation involves a number (`foo`) and a string (`"1"`). JavaScript automatically converts the number to a string for the concatenation, known as implicit type coercion.

**Implicit Coercions:**
1. **Definition:**
   - Implicit coercions happen when JavaScript automatically converts values from one type to another without explicit instructions from the developer.

2. **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const numberAsString = "42";
   const result = numberAsString * 1; // JavaScript coerces the string to a number for the multiplication
   console.log(result); // Outputs: 42
   ```
   - Here, the string `"42"` is implicitly converted to a number when multiplied by 1.

**Considerations:**
1. **Convenience and Caveats:**
   - Implicit coercions can be convenient but may lead to subtle bugs when conversions happen unexpectedly.
   - Developers need to be mindful of implicit coercions, especially in scenarios where conversions might not occur as expected.

2. **Symbols and BigInts:**
   - For symbols and BigInts, JavaScript intentionally restricts certain implicit type conversions to maintain consistency and prevent unexpected behaviors.
