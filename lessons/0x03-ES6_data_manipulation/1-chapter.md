Typed arrays in JavaScript provide a way to work with raw binary data in memory buffers. Think of it like having a set of boxes where you can store different types of data, like numbers or characters, in a structured way.

Imagine you have a bunch of storage boxes, each designed to hold a specific type of item. Some boxes are for storing numbers, some for storing text, and so on. These boxes are like the "buffers" in typed arrays.

Now, to access the contents of these boxes, you need a way to view them. That's where the "views" come in. Views provide a way to look into the boxes and see what's inside, specifying things like the type of data stored, where it starts, and how many items are in there.

Typed arrays are handy when you're working with low-level data, like when dealing with audio or video manipulation or communicating over WebSockets. They offer a structured way to handle binary data, making it easier to interact with different parts of a dataset.

Although typed arrays share similarities with regular JavaScript arrays, they're not the same. You can't use regular array methods like push and pop with typed arrays, and calling Array.isArray() on a typed array will return false.

In summary, think of typed arrays as organized storage boxes for binary data, with views providing a way to peek inside and see what's there. They're useful for handling raw data efficiently and conveniently.
