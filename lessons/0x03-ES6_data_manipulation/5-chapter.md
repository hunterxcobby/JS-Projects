The `DataView` interface in JavaScript provides a low-level mechanism for reading and writing arbitrary data to a buffer. Let's break down how it works using an analogy of a custom-made data interpreter:

1. **Data Interpreter**: Imagine you have a data interpreter in a room filled with boxes of different sizes, each containing raw data. This interpreter knows how to read and write data from/to these boxes.

2. **Buffer Representation**: The room itself represents the buffer, which is a contiguous space in memory holding the raw data. Each box in the room contains a piece of data.

3. **Reading and Writing Data**: The data interpreter can read and write data to/from the boxes using a special API. This API allows precise control over how data is accessed, including the byte order (endianness) and the data type.

4. **Endianness Control**: By default, the data interpreter reads data from the boxes in a specific byte order, usually big-endian (from most significant to least significant byte). However, you can instruct the interpreter to switch to little-endian mode (from least significant to most significant byte) if needed.

5. **No Alignment Requirement**: Unlike typed array views, which require alignment and fixed-length arrays, the data interpreter in our analogy can read and write multi-byte data from/to any offset within the buffer without alignment restrictions.

6. **Example Usage**: The provided JavaScript code defines a function `toBinary` that uses a `DataView` to convert numbers into their binary representation. This function allows you to specify parameters like the data type, endianness, separator, and radix for formatting the binary output.

7. **Sample Output**: The `toBinary` function demonstrates how to use a `DataView` to convert numbers into binary representation, showing both big-endian and little-endian formats.

Here's the breakdown of the example output:
- `toBinary(1.1)`: Converts the number 1.1 into binary representation, displaying the bytes in big-endian format.
- `toBinary(1.1, { littleEndian: true })`: Converts the same number into binary but in little-endian format.
- `toBinary(20, { type: "Int8", radix: 2 })`: Converts the number 20 into binary using 8-bit signed integer type and radix 2 (binary).
