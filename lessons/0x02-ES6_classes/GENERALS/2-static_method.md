Adding a static method to a class in JavaScript provides a way to define functionality that is associated with the class itself, rather than with instances of the class. Static methods are useful for utility functions, operations that don't require access to instance-specific data, and for creating instances of the class. Here's why and how to add a static method to a class:

### Why Add a Static Method:

1. **Utility Functions**:
   - Static methods are ideal for defining utility functions that are related to the class but do not depend on specific instances of the class.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Static methods encapsulate behavior that is closely related to the class, providing a clean and organized way to define class-specific functionality.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - By separating static methods from instance methods, you can clearly distinguish between operations that are related to instances and those that are not.

### How to Add a Static Method:

To add a static method to a class, use the `static` keyword followed by the method definition within the class body. Static methods can be accessed directly on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class.

### Example:

```javascript
class MathUtils {
  // Static method to calculate the square of a number
  static square(x) {
    return x * x;
  }

  // Static method to calculate the cube of a number
  static cube(x) {
    return x * x * x;
  }
}

// Accessing static methods directly on the class
console.log(MathUtils.square(5)); // Output: 25
console.log(MathUtils.cube(3)); // Output: 27
```

In this example, `square` and `cube` are static methods of the `MathUtils` class. They can be called directly on the class without the need to create an instance of the class. This makes them useful for defining general-purpose utility functions that are associated with the class.
