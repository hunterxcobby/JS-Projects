In JavaScript classes, when instance or static methods are called without a value for `this`, such as when the method is assigned to a variable and then called, the `this` value inside the method will be `undefined`. This behavior is consistent even if the "use strict" directive isn't present because code within the class body is always executed in strict mode.

### Example: Binding `this` with Instance and Static Methods

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    return this;
  }
  static eat() {
    return this;
  }
}

const obj = new Animal();
obj.speak(); // Output: the Animal object
const speak = obj.speak;
speak(); // Output: undefined

Animal.eat(); // Output: class Animal
const eat = Animal.eat;
eat(); // Output: undefined
```

In this example:
- When calling `obj.speak()`, `this` refers to the `Animal` object, as expected for an instance method.
- However, when `speak` is assigned to a variable and then called directly (`speak()`), `this` becomes `undefined`.
- Similarly, when calling `Animal.eat()`, `this` refers to the `Animal` class itself.
- But when `eat` is assigned to a variable and then called directly (`eat()`), `this` becomes `undefined`.

If we were to rewrite the above using traditional function-based syntax in non-strict mode, then `this` method calls would automatically be bound to the global object. However, in strict mode, the value of `this` remains as `undefined`.
