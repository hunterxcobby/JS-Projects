When a class declaration or expression is evaluated in JavaScript, its various components are evaluated in a specific order to ensure proper initialization. Let's break down the evaluation order:

1. **Extends Clause**:
   - If present, the extends clause is evaluated first.
   - It must evaluate to a valid constructor function or null; otherwise, a TypeError is thrown.

2. **Constructor Method**:
   - The constructor method is extracted next, or a default implementation is substituted if the constructor is not present.
   - However, since the constructor definition is only a method definition, this step is not observable.

3. **Property Keys**:
   - The property keys of class elements are evaluated in the order of declaration.
   - If a property key is computed, the computed expression is evaluated, with the `this` value set to the surrounding context (not the class itself).
   - None of the property values are evaluated yet at this stage.

4. **Installation of Methods and Accessors**:
   - Methods and accessors are installed next in the order of declaration.
   - Instance methods and accessors are installed on the prototype property of the current class.
   - Static methods and accessors are installed on the class itself.
   - Private instance methods and accessors are saved to be installed on the instance directly later.
   - This step is not observable.

5. **Initialization with Extends and Constructor**:
   - The class is initialized with the prototype specified by extends and the implementation specified by constructor.
   - If an evaluated expression tries to access the name of the class during this process, a ReferenceError is thrown because the class is not fully initialized yet.

6. **Evaluation of Values**:
   - For each instance field (public or private), its initializer expression is saved.
   - The initializer is evaluated during instance creation, either at the start of the constructor for base classes or immediately before the super() call returns for derived classes.
   - For each static field (public or private), its initializer is evaluated with `this` set to the class itself, and the property is created on the class.
   - Static initialization blocks are evaluated with `this` set to the class itself.

7. **Fully Initialized Class**:
   - The class is now fully initialized and can be used as a constructor function.

Understanding the evaluation order of class declarations and expressions in JavaScript ensures that classes are properly initialized and ready for use in your code.
