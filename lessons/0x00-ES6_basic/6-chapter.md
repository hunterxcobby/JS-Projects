Chapter 2: Block-Scoped Variables

In JavaScript, block-scoped variables are variables that are limited in scope to the block in which they are declared. This means that they are accessible only within that block and not outside of it.

1. **Using `let` for Block Scoping**:
   - The `let` keyword is used to declare block-scoped variables.
   - Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block they are declared in, including any nested blocks.
   - Block-scoped variables are not accessible outside of the block in which they are declared.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     {
       let x = 10;
       console.log(x); // Output: 10
     }
     console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined
     ```

2. **Benefits of Block Scoping**:
   - Block-scoped variables help prevent variable pollution and conflicts between different parts of the code.
   - They provide better control over variable access and help in writing more maintainable and bug-free code.

Understanding block-scoped variables is crucial for writing clean and organized JavaScript code, as it allows for better management of variable scope and reduces the likelihood of unintended side effects.
