Chapter 1: Understanding Constants and Variables

In JavaScript, both constants and variables are used to store data, but they have different behaviors and purposes.

1. **Constants**:
   - Constants are declared using the `const` keyword.
   - Once a value is assigned to a constant, it cannot be reassigned.
   - Constants provide a way to store values that should not change throughout the program's execution.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     const pi = 3.14;
     ```

2. **Variables**:
   - Variables are declared using the `let` or `var` keyword.
   - Variables can be reassigned after declaration.
   - They are used for storing data that may change during the program's execution.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let count = 0;
     ```

Understanding the difference between constants and variables is essential for managing data in JavaScript programs. Constants are suitable for values that should remain constant, while variables are used for values that may change over time.
