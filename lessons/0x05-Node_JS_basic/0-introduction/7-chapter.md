Let's break down ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and newer JavaScript features, and how they interact with Node.js, using simple analogies and clear steps.

### Understanding ECMAScript and Node.js

**ECMAScript (ES)** is the specification that standardizes JavaScript. New versions of ECMAScript introduce new features and improvements. Node.js integrates these features through its V8 engine.

### Key Feature Categories

1. **Shipping Features**:
   - **Definition**: Features that are stable and fully supported by Node.js.
   - **Availability**: Turned on by default; no extra flags are needed.
   - **Example**: Arrow functions, classes, and template literals introduced in ES6.

2. **Staged Features**:
   - **Definition**: Features that are almost complete but not yet considered stable.
   - **Availability**: Require a runtime flag to be enabled, specifically `--harmony`.
   - **Example**: Some features from later ECMAScript versions that are not fully finalized.

3. **In-Progress Features**:
   - **Definition**: Features that are still being developed and are not yet ready for general use.
   - **Availability**: Activated by specific flags, but using them is not recommended unless for experimental purposes.
   - **Example**: Experimental syntax or APIs that might change.

### Checking Supported Features

- **Shipping Features**: Node.js automatically supports these. To see which features are supported in your version of Node.js, visit [node.green](https://node.green).
- **Staged Features**: Enable with `--harmony` if you need to test features that aren't fully stable.
- **In-Progress Features**: Use the following command to see available in-progress features:

  ```bash
  node --v8-options | grep "in progress"
  ```

  This command shows features that are under development. Be cautious as these features might be unstable or change.

### Flags and Stability

- **`--harmony` Flag**: Used to enable staged features. It is equivalent to `--es_staging` and should be avoided in production environments due to potential instability.
- **Advice**: Remove the `--harmony` flag for production code to avoid issues if features change before becoming stable.

### Finding V8 Version in Node.js

To check which version of V8 your Node.js version is using:

```bash
node -p process.versions.v8
```

This command prints the V8 version integrated with your Node.js, which helps understand which ECMAScript features are supported by default.

### Summary

- **ECMAScript Versions**: New features are categorized as shipping, staged, or in-progress.
- **Shipping Features**: Stable and enabled by default.
- **Staged Features**: Require `--harmony` flag, use with caution.
- **In-Progress Features**: Experimental and should be used carefully.
- **Check V8 Version**: Use `node -p process.versions.v8` to see the V8 version.

By keeping your Node.js and V8 versions up to date, you can leverage the latest ECMAScript features and improvements.
